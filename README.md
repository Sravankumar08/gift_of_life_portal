# gift_of_life_portal
a blood donation portal with chatbot and mail notification 
i developed the gift of Life portal to address challenges in blood donation by  simplifying the process through donor, recipient, and administrator modules,  fostering effciency and security.
Seamlessly connecting donors and administrators, the portal manages queries, registrations, and blood requests, integrating a chatbot for user interaction while prioritizing data security via robust encryption measures.
i used php as a major language for backend and for frontend i used html,bootstrap,javascript and for database i used mysql. 
to use this you must need xampp server.
